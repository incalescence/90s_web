# The Old Web 
[Aug 2021]
<br>
90s and early two thousands inspired sticker book. This was one of the first web pages I made, inspired by the funky and colorful aesthetic of old personal sites. Keeping in tradition, I coded this on Windows Notepad, which was tough but rewarding. It allowed me to focus on mastering the syntax of HTML and CSS without any external autocompletion tools. Many of the graphics I used were taken from graphics libraries found on the WayBack Machine (*ahh nostalgia*).
